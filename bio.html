        </div>

        <div id = "blocktext">
        
        <p>Born in the small island-nation of Singapore, Theodore spent his
        younger days trying to come to terms with the constant humidity of a
        country lying one-degree north of the equator, as well as attempting
        to pick up skills that he would need later on in life. Growing up, he
        always imagined that he would become an author destined to churn out 
        the next New York Times Bestseller or Man Booker Prize Winner. To 
        make that dream a reality, he would staple haphazardly cut sheets of
        drawing block paper together and pretend that he was publishing his 
        own (handwritten) novel.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, as life would have it, Theodore discovered that
        writing was hard and attaining any form of recognition through
        writing was even harder. As such, he meandered through Middle and High
        School trying to figure out what interested him enough to pursue for 
        the rest of his life. Eventually, after dabbling in advanced math and 
        theatre studies among other things, he finally settled on studying the
        discipline of History at the Undergraduate level.</p>

        <p>Now, Theodore is a History and Computer Science double-major after
        his encounters with a newfound love for coding and problem solving. In 
        his (very limited) spare time, he can be found in the gym engaging in
        some form of sports, out and about capturing moments with his Canon
        DSLR, or finding a quiet spot to revert back to his first love -- 
        writing.</p>
